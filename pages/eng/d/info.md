# Experiment about attention and brain stimulation

#### What was the colour of the flowers surrounding the dog?
* If you guessed **blue**, you guessed correct!

* Do you want to learn more about your attention? Be a participant in our study!

* In our study you will (sadly) not be looking at cute pictures of dogs or cats. We are investigating how we might influence our attention with brain stimulation. We use a task that puts on a fight for your attention interleaved with none-invasive brain stimulation (read below). 

* This is a Research Student Programme ("forskerlinje" - in psychology) project at UiT

* The project have been ethically approved by regional ethics committee (REK nord)


### Short about the experiment: 
* We will be using [repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)](https://uitpsypro.github.io/2/eng/d/rtms)
  * A non-invasive brain stimulation procedure (click on the link above to learn more)
* The experiment consists of two sessions (2 meetings):
  * Where you receive both **real rTMS stimulation** at one of the sessions and **placebo (fake) rTMS stimulation** at another session
  * Both you, the participant, and the researchers will **not know** which stimulation you will receive to either session (blinding)
* A single session will require around 2 to 2.5 hours
* The second session will be, at minimum, 7 days after the first session
* To quality for the giftcard at Jekta (500 NOK) you must participate in both sessions
* Testing at UiT [house 5](https://use.mazemap.com/#v=1&zlevel=3&center=18.972235,69.682144&zoom=16.7&campusid=5&sharepoitype=poi&sharepoi=1000459387)


### Risk & side effects
* This brain stimulation procedure is very potent and **might** elicit an epileptic seizure
  * HOWEVER, this is **very** rare in healthy adults
* You might experience some sideeffects like:
  * Headache
  * Burning sensations 
  * Skin-reddness 
  * Light headedness
  * Tingling
  * Neck pain


### To be able to participate you need to meet these criterias: 
* **Be righthanded**
* Between the ages of 18 to 50
* Good or corrected eyesight
* Have no psychological/neurological diseases currently or in the past (e. g. major depression, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, migraine, severe head injury, brain surgery, ADHD)
* Not pregnant
* No history of epilepsy in the family (first-degree relatives)
* Not taking any medication targeting the central nervous system (e. g. antidepressants, antiepileptics)
* No metal implants (e.g., pacemaker, cochlea implant)
* No electronical devices in the body
