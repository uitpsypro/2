# Repetetive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)

* Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), is a non-invasive method of brain stimulation
* The magnetic coil is placed over the scalp of the person being stimulated
* The magnetic field penetrates the skull and the electric stimulus influence neurons in the brain, under the coil
* Repetetive transcranial magnetic stimulation is a method to modulate brain activity
* Repetitive TMS means that the magnetic field will turn on and off multiple times in a single stimulation round
